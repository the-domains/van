I don't know if there's a god. I think the best we can say. We have no evidence of a god. And we haven't searched everywhere. So it's unknown. People automatically think of the unknown as something negative. **We attempt to rationalize the unknown rather than spending time enjoying the known and being in awe of the unknown.** I'd rather not know everything than attempt to create a non-evidence-based claim to explain what we don't know. NdT said that pretending to know everything closes the door to finding out what's really there.

So if there's no proof of a god, why are we here? Scientifically speaking, because over billions of years, a series of random coincidences finally happened in an order that was conducive to life, and not just life in general, but particularly our human lives. There's a quote from Watchmen that says, "Events with astronomical odds of occurring.. I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect that in human coupling, millions upon millions of cells compete to create life, for generation after generation until, finally... Against unfathomable odds, it's you--only you--that emerged. To distill so specific a form, from all that chaos. It's a miracle." It could have been any other sperm and egg that could have resulted in someone that wasn't you. Now multiply the unfathomable odds of you in the context of human coupling by billions of years. That's why we're here. Statistically speaking, we're not special. We're just chance. We're only special because we think we are. But if you ask me, our perceptions are the only thing that matters. Our perception of how the world drives our motivations within it.

Life has no purpose other than the one(s) we create. Now that's fucking awesome.
