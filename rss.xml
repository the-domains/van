            <description><![CDATA[<p>I don't know if there's a god. I think the best we can say. We have no evidence of a god. And we haven't searched everywhere. So it's unknown. People automatically think of the unknown as something negative. We attempt to rationalize the unknown rather than spending time enjoying the known and being in awe of the unknown. I'd rather not knowÂ everything than attempt to create a non-evidence-based claim to explain what we don't know. NdT said that pretending to know everything closes the door to finding out what's really there.</p>]]></description>
